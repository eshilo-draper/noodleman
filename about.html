			<h1>About Mr. Noodleman</h1>
			</br>
			<h2>About the storyline</h2>
			<p class = "answer">Mr. Noodleman is a surrealist allegory. It's not supposed to entirely make sense. There is little logic to the world, the characters don't do what you would expect, the premise in general is nonsensical. There's a deeper meaning. Don't question my strangeness.</p>
			<h2>About the art</h2>
			<p class = "answer">Mr. Noodleman is written, penciled and inked by Ethan Shilo-Draper. All pages are originally ink on paper, with some digital manipulation for optimal viewing.</p>
			<h2>About the creator</h2>
			<p class = "answer">[REDACTED]</p>
			<h2>About the website</h2>
			<p class = "answer">I wrote all of the HTML and CSS for this site myself. Please feel free to <a href="external links.html">contact me</a> about issues with the site. Or just to chat, I get lonely sometimes.<p>

			<h1>FAQs</h1>
			<h2>What is Mr. Noodleman an allegory for?</h2>
			<p class = "answer">I don't intend to ever reveal this, but I promise that there is a consistent metaphor. Feel free to send and discuss theories, but I am unlikely to confirm or deny.</p>
